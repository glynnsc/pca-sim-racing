### Terminology
Have a strategy for testing and developing a setup.
Considerations:
Driving Style
Track Style (Fast vs slow corners, most important sectors)
Track Surface (High vs Low Grip)
Conditions & Time of Day

Setup should optimize the following:
Maximize confidence based no driving style
Maximize consistency and precision in most important sectors and corners
Minimize average laptime

Focus Areas for Set-Up Changes:
1. Center of Gravity and Corner Balance
# Ride Height - low as possible front and rear with base suspension settings
    - consider adjustments to suspension geometry, rake, and weight transfers

2. Tire Patch and Tire Temp
Target Temps are 180 - 200 (I think)
Inner Middle Outer (IMO)
# Camber:
Minimize IMO Temp differences (+/10F) with Camber
- Recheck after other settings that affect suspesion geometry

3. Choose (3) corners to optimize

4. Full Throttle Apex to Exit
Add throttle and unwind steering
Predictable rotation (slightly loose is ok on exit)
# Rear ARB
Run as stiff as possible, then soften to add grip and achieve corner exit
# Rear Toe-In
Increase rear toe-in
Consider tire patch and temps
# Dampers


5. Turn-In and Trail Braking
Smooth, responsive, predictable turn-in with slight understeer
Able to use trail braking for car placement and rotation
Ready to unwind steering and add throttle at apex
# Front ARB:
Run ARB as stiff as possible, reduce to achieve turn-in feel and control
# Front Toe-Out:
Increase toe-out to improve turn-in.
Consider braking and tire patch and temps

6. Mid-Corner Balance
Car should maintain weigth transfer and take a set
Controllable and predictable balanced during transistion from trail-brake to throttle
# Dampers:
Twitchy = reduce dampers
Unresponsive = increase dampers
I don't have a lot of experience with these adjustments
So will error on the side of stiffness until learning more
Base set up is 8s all around.
What would happen they were all 16 or all 0?


##########
Toe
Front
Corner Entry = Toe-out for better turn-in
Rear
Corner Exit = Roe-in for better stability

##########
Camber Typically 0-3 degrees
Maximize tire performance as determined by IMO temps

##########
Tire
IMO Temperature
Inside, Middle, Outside
Should be within tire optimal temperature after 2-3 laps
Should be within +/- (5C, 10F) IMO

##########
Anti-Roll Bar (ARB)
Softer/lower setting translates to more grip
Only effects one end of vehicle
Front = turn-in to apex
Use to dial in turn-in, trailbraking and rotation
Less ARB = more front grip = more turn-in = more oversteer

Rear = apex to exit
Use to dial in corner exit and throttle-on rotation
Less ARB = more rear grip = more stable exit = understeer


##########
Ride Height
Low as possible to reduce center of gravity
Consider geometry and bottoming out in corners and bumps
Consider aero induced changes

##########
Springs
Spring-rate = rate of compression
Bigger number = stiffer spring = less weight transfer = less grip transfered to that corner
Can be effected and effect suspension geometry under loads
Also related to ride height under loads
Considerations: Load, Ride Height, Track Surface and Downforce
Front
Braking and turn-in to apex
Reduce spring rate for more weight transfer to front
Rear
Apex to exit
Reduce spring rate for more weight transfer to rear
##########
Dambers (Shock Absorbers)
Moderators of Spring movement
Higher Number = More Resistance to Spring Movement = Lower Rate of Change
Bumb Number should be lower than rebound number
Bump = Compression Speed
Rebound = Decompression Speed
Slow Bump = Compression Speed during braking and cornering
Fast Bump = Compression Speed going over bumps and curbs
Slow Rebound = Rebound Speed during braking and cornering
Fast Rebound = Rebound Speed going over bumps and curbs
Front & Rear
Twitchy = reduce numbers
Unresponsive = increase numbers
