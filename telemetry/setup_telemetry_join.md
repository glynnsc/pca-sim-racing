after applying setup changes, apply the logic below to identify to identify the laps associated with a setup change

session__date == same
session__starttime == increment
lapcompleted == 0
lap == 0

looked through many other telemetry fields and nothing else changes in consistent way with laps following setup changes

Also need to pull setup data and weekend data for full details associated with telemetry data
